# Surface Water Floating Detection platform üßê
 
It's an amazing Objection Platform, mainly attention Floating on water surface. You can detect anything use it, but you need replace dataset in your task!
<br>
This platform identify and classify a kind of types of flaoting objects in real-time. while Flask provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the platrofm.(‚Ä¢ÃÉ‚ÄØ·¥ó‚Ä¢ÃÉ)
<br>
this platform base on YoloV5üöÄ object detect algorithm, and Flask, a Web framework.üé®

## Getting Started ‚òú(ÀÜ‚ñøÀÜc)
 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
 
### Prerequisites
 
 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

run as test:
```
python3 -u app.py
```

run as server: 
```
nohup python3 -u app.py > run.log 2>&1 &
```

 
## Deployment
 

## Built With
 
* [Flask](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The Web framework used
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Deep Learning framework.
* [YoloV5_u](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) - yolov5 implement ultralytics edition
* [YoloV5](https://github.com/bubbliiiing/yolov5-pytorch) - yolov5 implement other edition (bubbliiiing in bilibili)
